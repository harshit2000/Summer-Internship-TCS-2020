# Automate detection of different emotions from paragraphs and predict overall emotions


## Table of Contents

> ### About the Project
This Project is about automating the identification and extraction of the emotion of the paragraph text and predicting overall emotion of the text. It is basically a problem of NLP (Natural Language Processing). Sentiment analysis can predict many different emotions attached to the text. Here in this project not only emotions of the text are predicted but also the process is automated. Analyzing the public sentiment and automating the process helps in many ways as firms try to find out the response of their products in the market, predicting political elections and predicting socioeconomic phenomena like the stock exchange.
